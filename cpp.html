            <p>C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an
                extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly
                over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to
                facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language,
                and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel,
                Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[10] </p>
            <p>C++ was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained
                software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design
                highlights.[11] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software
                infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[11] including desktop applications, video games,
                servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g.
                telephone switches or space probes).[12]</p>
            <p>C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard
                version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as
                C++20).[13] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which
                was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes
                these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998,
                C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension
                of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided
                high-level features for program organization.[14] Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release
                schedule[15] with C++23 as the next planned standard.[16]</p>
